## DATA PRE-PROCESSING
#### DATA LOADING

## Import all the necessary python packages 
```Python
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```
#reading the sales data into panda data frame
```Python
bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/uthma/OneDrive/Desktop/Data Set/bikes.csv")

bikes_df.head()
```
## Data Modification
```Python
#Adding the following 3 columns to your pansdas Dataframe:  bikes_df
# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 



# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)



bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()


```

## DATA ANALYSIS
```Python
#Filtering out only the data relevant to solve the problem statements

IS_USA = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"
For_bk = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"
bikes_df[(IS_USA) & (For_bk)].head()


```

#### DATA AGGREGATION
```Python
For_bk_in_USA = bikes_df[(IS_USA) & (For_bk)].pivot_table(values = "Profit",index = "CustomerState", aggfunc = np.sum)


For_bk_in_USA

```

```Python
For_bk_in_USA.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False)
```

#### RESULT

#Top Most-Profitable 5 States for a Bike business in the United States ?

Top_5_most_profitable_states_us = For_bk_in_USA.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False).head()
Top_5_most_profitable_states_us
